1. Introduction
*****************************************************************************

    Vavoom is a source port based on the sources of Doom, Heretic, Hexen,
  "a little bit" from Quake, (G)ZDoom, and others. Supported platforms are
  Windows and GNU/Linux. A dedicated server also can be compiled on OpenBSD
  and possibly on other UNIX systems, but this may require some changes.
    If you find any bugs, feel free to report them.


*****************************************************************************
2. Requirements
*****************************************************************************

Vavoom System Requirements:
     - Pentium IV processor or better
     - 256 MB RAM
     - GPU with support for OpenGL 2.1 and GLSL 1.20

  To play Vavoom you need the main wad file from one of the following games:
     - Doom shareware
     - Registered Doom
     - Ultimate Doom
     - Doom 2: Hell on Earth
     - Doom 2: TNT Evilution
     - Doom 2: The Plutonia experiment
     - Heretic shareware
     - Heretic registered
     - Hexen
     - Strife shareware
     - Strife
     - Freedoom
  If you have multiple IWADs, you can use command line params -doom, -doom2,
-tnt, -plutonia, -heretic, -hexen or -strife to look for IWADs only for that
game. Hexen requires a wad file from version 1.1.


*****************************************************************************
3. Installation
*****************************************************************************

==============================================================================
3.1 GNU/Linux / UNIX installation
==============================================================================

In order to compile and run Vavoom under Linux, you need the following:

Compiler and tools:
    * GNU C++ Compiler, (every GNU/Linux user must have them)
    * CMake (http://cmake.org)
Libraries:
    * SDL 2 (http://www.libsdl.org)
    * OpenAL-Soft (https://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html)
    * OpenGL: OpenGL implementation from your video card's manufacturer
      or MESA (http://www.mesa3d.org) and X-Windows development libraries.
Optional:
    * libvorbis (https://xiph.org/vorbis/)
    * libopus (https://opus-codec.org)
    * libmad (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)
    * FLAC (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)

  And of course the Vavoom sources.

Step by step:
-------------

  1. Get the Vavoom sources (via git, or in some other way).

  2. Run the CMake:

    cmake .

  Here are some CMake parameters you may want to use:

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH  - specify prefix of installation. Default is
                                   /usr/local

  3. Run make in the main directory.

    make

  This will compile the Vavoom executable, utilities, progs and will build the
additional wad files.

  4. Then you install it:

    su -c "make install"

  This will install Vavoom into {prefix}.

  5. Change to Vavoom data directory and copy the main .wad file here or create
a symbolic link to it:

        cd {prefix}/share/vavoom
        cp <where-your-wad-file-is> .
   or:
        cd {prefix}/share/vavoom
        ln -s <where-your-wad-file-is> .

  Also make sure that the file/symbolic link name is in lower case.


*****************************************************************************
4. Starting a net game
*****************************************************************************

  WARNING! Network code is not finished. It should be fairly stable, but in
           its current form it doesn't support some features, may crash, and
           better played over LAN.

  The default socket port is 26000. It can be changed in the console with
the command "port <port>".

  Now network game can be launched from the main menu. It's Quake-like, so you
should not have problems with it.

  Here is a list of the most important server console variables and commands
for dedicated server operators.

Server console variables:
-------------------------

    DeathMatch          -   0 - cooperative, other - deathmatch, in Doom
                            1 - like -deathmatch param was
                            2 - -altdeath param was like - items and weapons are
                                respawning
                            3 - like 2, but monsters are respawning very fast
                                and they are attacking each other - total nightmare
    NoMonsters          -   0 - enable, 1 - disable monsters;
    TimeLimit           -   Replaces command line param -time, sets time (in
                            minutes), after which the level will automatically end,
                            0 for no limit, works only in deathmatch.
    HostName            -   Name, listed in server list and that can be used to
                            connect to this server.
    Skill               -   Game skill, 0 - very easy / 4 - nightmare

Server console commands:
------------------------

    MaxPlayers [<players>]

  Changes maximum number of players. It can only be executed when the server is
not running, for dedicated servers it's only executed on command line.

    Map <mapname>

  Shuts down the current server and spawns a new one in the specified map. As
you understand all the clients are dropped.


*****************************************************************************
5. Command line parameters
*****************************************************************************

  All the console commands can be specified at the command line by prefixing
them with the + symbol, they will be executed after executing basev/startup.vs.
  Some examples:
    +SetResolution 640 480 16
    +Exec myconfig.cfg
    +Map MAP03
